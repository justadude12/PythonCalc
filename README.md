# PythonCalc
A calculator made in Python using the Tkinter library to handle the GUI


I started this project to familiarize myself with Python in order to get ready for an internship in which I will be using Python.
It is also a handy way to learn about implementing a GUI in Python using Tkinter, and a very basic project, to which one can however
add a lot of complexity in comparison to just a base calculator.
